Use learning machine to get a better «friction less» user experience (automatic products selection for the next order )
> Karibou.ch is a community project and a online marketplace whose goal is to create a quality and healthy food distribution system. Our plateform mainly focus on primary food distribution (eg. organic vegetables from farms, artisanal bread, artisanal cheese, meat from farms)

## Objectives of this project
Based on existent database orders and other inputs, we would like to build a machine learning system that will drastically make the order process frictionless. 

## Problem to solve
Currently a user that want to place a new order have to navigate on different categories and select manually each products. This process could be long and some products may be missed. Navigation through categories is often annoying. Moreover, when there are many products the organization of the lists is often of poor quality. 

## Proposed solutions

1. Using machine learning to create an list of products that will fit the needs of one user
2. The machine learning will also create a weight of the categories to display first.
3. User can add input to specify if product  is relevant (yes, not this time, never) 
4. based on thoses input, the machine learning will dynamically create clusters of profiles that we can consult
5. we can create a mobile version (based on our current sketch code) that will create an automatic order that can be confirmed by tapping one button (not relevant product can also be nottified here)

## ROADMAP
