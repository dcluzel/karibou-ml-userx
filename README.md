## Introduction

This page lists __karibou.ch learning machine__ project ideas for [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/). GSoC is a program run every year by Google where students are paid to work on open source projects during their summer break. If you are a student and interested in taking part then please read the [Advice for Students](#advice-for-students) section below. Everybody (not just students) is free to edit this page and add project ideas.

> Karibou.ch is an opensource community project and a online marketplace whose goal is to help a quality and healthy food to be distribued. Our plateform mainly focus on primary food distribution (eg. organic vegetables from farms, artisanal bread, artisanal cheese, meat from farms) 



## Objectives of this project
Get a better «friction less» user experience based on stored activities we would like to build a «intelligent» system that will drastically make the order process without friction. 

## Problem to solve
Currently a user that want to place a new order have to navigate on different categories and select manually each products. This process could be long and some products may be missed. Navigation through categories is often annoying. Moreover, when there are many products the organization of the lists is often of poor quality. 

## Main solution idea

1. Using machine learning to create an list of products that will fit the needs of one user
2. The machine learning will also create a weight of the categories to display first.
3. User can add input to specify if product  is relevant (yes, not this time, never) 
4. based on thoses input, the machine learning will dynamically create clusters of profiles that we can consult
5. we can create a mobile version (based on our current sketch code) that will create an automatic order that can be confirmed by tapping one button (not relevant product can also be nottified here)

  Required knowledge: machine learning, deep learning, nodejs, gulp, npm, mongodb
  Difficulty level: intermediate
  Potential mentors: tbd


## ROADMAP
This repository contains all materials needed to implement this idea.
